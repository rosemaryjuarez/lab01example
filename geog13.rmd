- In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages 
- learned how to include an image
- learning how to change font and colors to icons
- becoming more familiar with Rstudio
- Includes a github repo for access to all the code.
- I also faced a lot of trouble in this project, luckily professor Mike Johnson helped throughout my troubles!
- MY WORK LOOKS GREAT!
